# DiD-and-Panel-model-(New-regulation-effects-on-financial-institutions)
Motivation
In our study, we want to replicate the conclusions of (Keppo et al) on "Risk targeting and policy illusions real"

In this project, we use DiD and panel models to answer the following questions:
1) Whether or not the Volcker rule announcement reduces the trading book to asset ratio in financial institutions.
2) If the announcement was successful, which banks responded the most and the least?.
